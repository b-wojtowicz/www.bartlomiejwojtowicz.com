My name is Bartłomiej Wójtowicz.
I'm a software engineer currently working at [Selleo](https://selleo.com?utm_source=qbart.dev&utm_campaign=qbart.dev). I specialize in backend development, databases and devops.
As a hobby I develop video games in [SoftKiwi](https://www.softkiwi.com/), play bunch of board games and I am trying to master Mario Tennis Aces.
I am also into sound design, Artificial Intelligence, game jams ([GGJ](https://globalgamejam.org/users/bwojtowicz)/[LD](https://ldjam.com/users/bart/games)) and learning new programming languages.
From time to time I tinker with Raspberry Pi.
